Create Fault Tolerant MongoDB Cluster
Now we will work on Create Fault Tolerant MongoDB Cluster. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

Set up a MongoDB Replica environment and start the replica servers.
Set up the Replica Configuration for each MongoDB server.
Populate the MongoDB database from a CSV file and query each server in the replica set.
Use a Replica set connection string to access the MongoDB database using Python's PyMongo.
Simulate server fault by stopping a MongoDB server and Observe one of the Secondary servers replacing the primary server using the Mongo Shell.
While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
